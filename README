This project is meant to provide a little bit of automation to the command line on my local machine. Each of the
directories in Automation/ is meant to hold the program for each improvement. Any future automations will also be kept
in this folder. Below is a summation of what each new command will do, and each individual folder has its own README
file to explain in more detail, as well as a error.txt folder that will hold and errors the programs have as well as a
time stamp of the error

compress <name> <target> [type]
	This program is meant to run a tar command in order to compress the the target file or directory. I do not often
	remember the tag used to compress files into .tar.tbz, so this will serve as a substitute for it. Files will be
	tarred by default into .tar.tbz files, but the user can use [type] to change it
    <name>	 - the name of the file after it is compressed, not including the file extension
    <target> - the target file or directory to compress
    [type]	 - where the user specifies what kind of file they want the target to be compressed
               into

project <name>
    This program will be a command that I use to initialize a new project. It will create a project folder and create and
	start a readme and .gitignore file
    <name>	 - The name of the new project

uncompress <target>
	This program will uncompress the target if it has the extension .gz, .tar.gz, .bz2, .tar.bz2, .tbz, or .tar.tbz
    <target> - The target to uncompress

upload <target> <object> | upload add <target> | upload remove <target>
	This program will be used to upload files to a target. This target will either be a shortcut as defined in a target
	list, or it can be input manually. Files will be uploaded using scp. The upload command will reserve the word "add"
	and "remove" (they cannot be used in the target or file spots) to be used to add and remove targets from the target
	list
    <target> - The target to upload to that is either on the target list or in the form of
               [username]@[hostname]:[file path]
    <object> - The file or directory to upload

Each command will be run as an alias in my .profile file in the home directory. This project is
meant to be run on a linux machine and the results of running the program may vary from machine
to machine. The programs will be written in python 3

I restructured the program so that all commands are routed through the main.py file in the Automation/ directory so that
all commands could make use of the check_error function in the helper_code/shared_functions.py file. Aliases for the
commands have to be written as:
'python3 <path to automation folder>/Automation/main.py <command name> <command arguments>'
